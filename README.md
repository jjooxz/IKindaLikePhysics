# IKindaLikePhysics
This is a simple [physics engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine) project im doing, to escape boredom and maybe add to my portifolio, i made this from scratch, so no excess library except for logging and graphics.

## How to use it
This is still in progress, maybe later i will transform this into a library like [bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) or something like that, im thinking of using it in more future projects, simulations or even games
