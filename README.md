# IKindaLikePhysics
This is a simple [physics engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine) project im doing, to escape boredom and maybe add to my portifolio, i made this from scratch, so no excess library except for logging and graphics.

## How to use it
This is still in progress, maybe later i will transform this into a library like [bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) or something like that, im thinking of using it in more future projects, simulations or even games

## Checklist
- [x] <strike>Made simple object class</strike>
- [x] <strike>Made first object</strike>
- [x] <strike>Made simple physics</strike>
- [x] <strike>(Basic) Collision implementation</strike>
- [x] <strike>Graphics</strike>
- [ ] More Objects
- [ ] Advanced Objects (Hinges, Springs, Motors, Etc)

I guess i wont update this no more, maybe another project like this will appear, with more complete things, this was just one thing i made because i was bored, but maybe next project will be better.
